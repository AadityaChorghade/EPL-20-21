Title: Exploratory Data Analysis of English Premier League 2020-2021 Season

Summary:

This project showcases an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the English Premier League (EPL) 2020-2021 season. The dataset consists of player performance statistics including goals, assists, yellow cards, club affiliations, and more. The objective of this analysis is to gain insights into various aspects of the EPL season and uncover interesting patterns or trends.

The project begins with data cleaning and pre-processing steps, which involve examining data quality, handling missing values, and creating new derived features. The cleaned dataset is then subjected to a comprehensive EDA using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

The EDA covers a wide range of visualizations and analyses, including total goals, penalty goals, player positions, nationalities, clubs, age groups, player comparisons, and correlation analysis. Bar charts, pie charts, box plots, and heatmaps are employed to visualize and interpret the data effectively.

The project provides valuable insights into player performance, team dynamics, and statistical relationships within the EPL. It demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, exploratory data analysis techniques, and data visualization using Python, making it a valuable addition to any data analysis portfolio.
